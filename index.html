        <section>
          <h2>What is RubyMine?</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>It's an IDE, silly!</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Yes this means it's more than just an editor. IDEs help you understand development projects as a whole.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>WARNING: Controversial statement ahead!</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Someone who's familiar with an IDE will always be more efficient than someone (of the same skill level) who's merely using an editor.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What do you mean by "editor"?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Atom, etc</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Full disclosure: I love Vim.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            I have a lovingly maintained setup that I use for Go and one-offs. It very well may be far more customized than what you use.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Why is there IDE hate in scripting language communities?</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            I've found that people who've worked with compiled code a lot have less of a hard time w/ the idea of an IDE. I don't buy the argument that says they are "crutches" or only for "people who think a certain way".
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>The actual Top 10</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              So now that we know that there's basically no reason for IDE hate in the Ruby world beyond the tautological, let's talk about why you'd want to use this.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>10. Control your Rails project [ADD SCREENSHOT OF CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT]</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Run specs, rake tasks, bundler commands, and more from inside RubyMine
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>9. Everything in one window</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              If you want to code on the couch, you can have all your stuff (including a terminal window) in one place. Work in the terminal, run bundler commands and rake tasks, use a Rails console, etc.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>8. Full Git support</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Deal with diffs, compare versions, switch branches, open lines on GitHub, create Gists from selections. Yes, many editors have plugins that can do this. W/ RubyMine, you don't have to install anything extra.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>7. Context Save/Load</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Save all open files and their positions as a "context" and then come back to it later. Perfect for when you have to jump on top of a hotfix but then want to get right back to all your code windows, etc later.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>6. Live Indexing: Crazy Code Navigation</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Cmd-Click on a method call or class name to go straight to its definition. Go "forward" and "back" in the stack of files (and their positions!) you've been looking at
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>5. Quickly Run Tests at Any Scope</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Put the cursor on the single test or (in RSpec/MiniTest) on the describe/context block start, use a key combo to run it in normal mode or through the debugger. Combine with window pane navigation to quickly run the last test you ran.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>4. Refactoring</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Related: Find Usage to get a collection of all the times a piece of code is used (even in dynamic calls!). This list is of course click-to-navigate.
              Quickly rename methods or classes globally (even in comments!) Extract portions of code into new methods or variables, and more.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>3. All Stack Traces are Hyper Links</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Any stack trace --whether in a  test failure, rake task, or anywhere else -- is a collection of hyperlinks into your code. This saves an AMAZING amount of time.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>2. ShiftShift to find ANYTHING</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Single, unified, fuzzy search for class names, file names, and even the names of methods.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>1. Graphical Debugger</p>
          </section>
          <aside class="notes">
            It's impossible to overstate how much time this has saved me over the years. Pry is great. I use it. But it's not graphical -- you have to reload your process.
            Effortlessly step into method calls, step over them to trace execution line-by-line, set watch expressions, break on exceptions (named and generally), and tons of other stuff.
            One really killer feature here: Shift-Cmd-D to run the spec under your cursor in debug mode.
